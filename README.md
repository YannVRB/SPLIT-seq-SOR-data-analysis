# SPLIT-seq data analysis

This repository describes our SPLIT-seq analysis between HC and SOR conditions.

The file "split-pipe code" contains the code used to run the split-pipe pipelien to pre-process the raw fastq files.

The file "SPLIT-SEQ R data analysis.R" contains the code in R language for downstream analyses, from normalizaing/scaling the data to the identification of speicifc clusters of celltype.

The file "scATAC-seq analysis.R" contains the code in R language for downstream analyses of the single-cell ATAC-seq data.
